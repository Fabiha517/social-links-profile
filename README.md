# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ) on Frontend Mentor. It's a responsive profile card that includes hover and focus states for social links.

- Managing screen sizes like iPad Pro and Nest Hub Max with specific media queries
- Using `::before`/`::after` and `box-sizing: inherit` for layout consistency
- Improving accessibility with focus/hover states

## 🚀 Future Improvements
